Thanks for considering me (Anders Martini) for employment!

In this repository I've chosen to use Spring Boot combined with RxJava for 
a reactive approach that in the real world would perform better, 
by making all IO async.
Of course, since the task specifically detailed not to
install any database, this repo uses in-memory storage instead,
making any performanceboost an async approach could deliver moot.
Still, I wanted to demonstrate my familiarity with the concept,
so I used it anyway.

I will confess here that I was a little confused about some details on this assignment.
Specifically I wonder at the types used in the provided JSON:
why is amount specified as a String? it seems to me that a number would make more sense, unless I'm missing something?
